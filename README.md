# Austin Marcus

I am a 2014 graduate of the Psychology department at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm currently working towards a second Bachelor's in computer science at the University of Pittsburgh (2018). I'm interested in the cognitive mechanisms and neural architecture underlying perception - more specifically, I'm interested in the processing, internal representation and integration of visual and auditory sensory information, the relationship between perception and semantic representations, and how this relationship is exploited in perceptual cognition and language processing. I am especially interested in the cortical architecture that gives rise to the many forms of synesthesia, and the similarities and differences between synesthetes and non-synesthetes in how their perceptual processes interact with semantic representations. My research combines approaches from both cognitive neuroscience and machine learning.

In the course of my research I employ (or plan to employ) both neuroimaging and computational modeling techniques to further understand the phenomena I'm interested in. I have performed (or will soon perform) EEG and fMRI imaging, in addition to dMRI connectivity mapping, and plan to explore deep network architectures that may approximate multimodal integration, both to better understand the corresponding cortical mechanisms and to apply these mechanisms to real-world computational and perceptual problems.
