I am a 2014 graduate of the Psychology department at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm currently working towards a second Bachelor's in computer science at the University of Pittsburgh (2018). I'm interested in the cognitive mechanisms and neural architecture underlying perception - more specifically, I'm interested in the processing, internal representation and integration of visual and auditory sensory information, and the relationship between perception and semantic representations. I am especially interested in the cortical architecture that gives rise to the many forms of synesthesia, and the similarities and differences between synesthetes and non-synesthetes in how they use perception to form and use semantic representations. My research combines approaches from the studies of perception and language, and I aim to uncover the processes that underlie and are intertwined throughout both.

In the course of my research I employ (or plan to employ) both neuroimaging and computational modeling techniques to further understand the phenomena I'm interested in. I have performed (or will soon perform) EEG and fMRI imaging, in addition to dMRI connectivity mapping, and plan to explore deep network architectures that may approximate multimodal integration, both to better understand the corresponding cortical mechanisms and to apply these mechanisms to real-world computational problems.
